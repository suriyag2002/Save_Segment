## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Get Your Webhook URL**:
   - Go to [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/).
   - Copy the unique webhook URL that appears on the screen.

2. **Modify the Axios Request**:
   In your React application, you can use the following function to send data to the webhook URL:

   ```javascript
   import axios from 'axios';

   const sendDataToWebhook = async (data) => {
       const webhookUrl = 'https://webhook.site/abcdefg-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678'; // Replace with your URL
       
       try {
           const response = await axios.post(webhookUrl, data);
           console.log('Data sent successfully:', response.data);
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error sending data:', error);
       }
   };

   // Example data to send
   const segmentData = {
       name: "Example Segment",
       value: 42
   };

   // Call the function to send data
   sendDataToWebhook(segmentData);
   ```

## Testing with Webhook.site

1. **Run Your Code**:
   - Ensure your React app is running. When the `sendDataToWebhook` function is called, it will send the specified `segmentData` to your webhook URL.

2. **Check Webhook.site for Data**:
   - Go back to your Webhook.site tab in the browser. You should see the data appearing in real-time under the "Recent Requests" section.
   - Click on the request to view the full details, including headers and body content.
